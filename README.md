# TeleCleanSlate(beta)

**TeleCleanSlate** is a simple tool designed to assist users in **permanently deleting their Telegram accounts and all associated data**. Unlike the standard account deletion method provided by Telegram, which leaves messages and files accessible to other users, **TeleCleanSlate aims to remove as many traces as possible**. With its command-line interface and comprehensive automation, TeleCleanSlate offers a secure and thorough method for managing the deletion process.

> **Warning:** This tool performs **complete and irreversible deletion** of your Telegram account and data. Proceed only if you fully understand the consequences.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

- **Permanent Deletion:** Once the account is deleted, **it cannot be recovered**. All messages, contacts, and chat histories will be lost forever.

- **No Liability:** The creator of this tool assumes **no responsibility** for any data loss or unintended consequences.
